Every restaurant has perfectly good food that they cannot sell at the end of their day. Large amount of these food goes wasted and is thrown away in the dumping zone. 

How can one efficiently prepare this food to avoid food wastage. What if there is a platform which collects statistics of each day on what were the items and their quantity was consumed. It will vary every day depending on factors like weekday/weekend/public holiday/festivals etc. 

Using Bread Saver platform, we aim to minimize the food preparation at the restaurant level using predictive analytics model. 

The restaurant operator will be feeding the statistics at the end of each day to the cloud database about the food consumed and food prepared.
In return, the application will forcast the quantity of food to be prepared for days in future and thus saving food wastage.
