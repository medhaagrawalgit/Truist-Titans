Short Description 

Every restaurant has perfectly good food that they cannot sell at the end of their day. Large amount of these food goes wasted and is thrown away in the dumping zone. 
How can one efficiently prepare this food to avoid food wastage. What if there is a platform which collects statistics of each day on what were the items and their quantity was consumed. It will vary every day depending on factors like weekday/weekend/public holiday/festivals etc. 

Using Bread Saver platform, we aim to minimize the food preparation at the restaurant level using predictive analytics model. With this platform the restaurant operator will be feeding the statistics at the end of each day to the cloud database about the food consumed and food prepared.

Long Description

Food waste is a major sustainability challenge . Approximately one-third of the food produced for human consumption being wasted.
Food waste does not only lead to environmental degradation but also inﬂates food prices and accelerates social inequality.
In order to feed the growing global population, it is necessary to better utilise the food produced for human consumption which in turn can reduce hunger.

Problem Statement :
A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers. Approximately 4 to 10 percent of food purchased by restaurants is wasted before reaching the consumer. Common causes of food waste in restaurants include overbuying, overproduction and spoilage.

Overbuying is often a result of inadequate forecasting of consumer demand and the large quantities of food that restaurants typically need to purchase at one time. Moreover, food orders are routinely in excess of real demand resulting in overproduction -creating food waste.
When food is not utilized in a timely manner, spoilage can render it unfit for consumption.

Solution proposed:
The key to reduce food wastage in Restaurants lies in accurate forecasting. 
Accurate forecasting of consumer demand, especially aided by the use of food waste data tracking software, can help limit overbuying of inventory. Forecasting for restaurants helps you get the most out of the data available to you, both in day-to-day decisions and long-term planning. For restaurant owners and operators always thinking two steps ahead, forecasting restaurant sales can be a key tool for meeting future challenges.
